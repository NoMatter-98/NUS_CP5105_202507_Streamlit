He has been a research scientist at the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence. His current research and teaching revolves around the scalability of experiential learning. With his NUS colleagues, he has scaled the experiential course CS1101S (computer science introduction) from 48 students in 2012 to 670 students in 2021. He founded the experiential course CS4215 Programming Language Implementation, and offers experiential undergraduate software projects. He has published in a wide range of areas, including computer science and engineering education, programming languages, combinatorial search, and electric vehicles. His work on CS1101S culminated in the textbook ""Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript Edition"", by Harold Abelson and Gerald J. Sussman, adapted to JavaScript by Martin Henz and Tobias Wrigstad, published by MIT Press in April 2022. CS1101S also motivated the development of the Source Academy, an immersive online experiential environment for learning programming used in CS1101S and at the University of San Francisco. He co-founded the software company Workforce Optimizer Pte Ltd with Alan Sevugan, and supervised Rahul Singhal's PhD, which led to the formation of the education company Cerebry.","Programming Languages & Software Engineering
